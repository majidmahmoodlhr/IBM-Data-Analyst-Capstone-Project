# Obtain an IBM Cloud Feature Code

To facilitate hands-on skills development and enable you to complete some of the labs in this course, we are providing you with a special feature code for IBM Cloud. 

This feature code will enable you to either create an IBM Cloud account without a credit card. 

Please check the box and click on the "Open Tool"  button below to get a unique Feature Code to activate your IBM Cloud trial account.

We have also provided you with the stepwise instructions on how to create an IBM Cloud account for your reference.

NOTE: If you have already applied your IBM Cloud feature code in another course/lab to create an IBM Cloud account, please skip this item, as the code can only be used once.
